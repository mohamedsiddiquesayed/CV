    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Mohamed Siddique and I am 25 years old. I live in a small suburb in the south of Johannesburg with my loving parents, sister and wife. I am a final year IT student currently studying at the North-West University. On the 19th of
      December 2020, I married my best friend, my beautiful wife Zahraa. On the 7th of November 2021 , my beautiful twin princesses were born . Thier names are Mariam and Hanna. They are currently in neonatal care at the Mediclinic in Vereenining as
      they were born premature.The excitement grows inside me as I wait for my twin baby girls to come home from
      hospital.Since March this year, I began my first full time job at a company called Sedgars.I really enjoy working there and have sinced , learnt many new things. I also enjoy a Sunday afternoon horse ride or just spending quality time with the
      family and obviously the beach (if only I livedcloser).</p>

    <h2>My Message</h1>
      <p>I am looking for an opportunity that would offer me an opening to not only utilize and extend my current knowledge, skills and experience but also afford me a chance to become part of a company that I can add value to. I enjoy a good
        challenge
        and
        the thrilling adventure. I have a passion for helping others andhave the kindest heart. On every aspect of the task at hand, I want to it to be a learning curve as I am a fast learner and would to work alongside some of the most talented and
        esteemed people who will guide and mentor me to become better each day.</p>
      <p>I enjoy meeting new people and can fit in with anyone because I hold relationships close to me. Relationships that become more than just colleagues and work. Most of all becoming the best and bringing out the best in others through
        dedication,
        respect, courage, team and family spirit and ultimately make a positive impact to get things done with quality and excellence.</p>
      <p>My goal is to constantly move forward and expose myself to cutting edge technology as well as engage with likeminded people with whom I can grow with through projects and tasks with the intention toachieve true greatness not only for myself
        but
        also the interest of the company and my team. My aim isto work smart and play hard to ensure that nothing stands in my way of reaching my true and full potential.</p>
      <p>I believe I can fly or at least when I am out in the pasture on horseback because honestly it feels like flying, just without wings. Just like this, it’s not the resources that decides the extraordinary but how you choose to use it is what
        really
        matters.</p>
